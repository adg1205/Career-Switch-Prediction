# Career-Switch-Prediction
This is my Artificial Intelligence Course project at BRAC University. The main goal of this project is to predict whether someone would switch their careers by using models like KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and also implementing Neural Networks to determine how accurately each model can predict whether someone would change their career or not.
